/**
 * Content Graph — Pixi scene.
 *
 * Owns the `pixi.Application`, the `world` container (pan + zoom
 * transform), and the four child layers:
 *
 *   1. `edgeLayer`      — line per `GraphEdge` (very thin, low alpha).
 *   2. `nodeLayer`      — per `GraphNode`: a `Graphics` halo, a
 *      `Graphics` disc, and a dashicon glyph, sized by degree. Which
 *      of the last two is the visible body depends on the node style
 *      (see {@link NodeStyle}); the halo is state-only.
 *   3. `labelLayer`     — text label per node, culled when zoomed out.
 *   4. `satelliteLayer` — `SatelliteLayer` instance fanning out
 *      relationship satellites around the focused node (see
 *      `satellites.ts`).
 *
 * Camera model: smooth target-then-ease, mirroring the `categories-
 * mindmap` reference. Wheel events update `targetScale` / `targetX` /
 * `targetY` exponentially with a sensitivity of 0.0008 per pixel; the
 * tick loop eases the live `world.scale` / `world.x` / `world.y`
 * toward the targets each frame so zoom and recenter feel continuous
 * rather than stepped.
 *
 * Visual policy: disc nodes coloured by post type (the same palette
 * the satellite bubbles use, so a focused post and its relationships
 * read as one system), dot-grid background (CSS), Obsidian-style
 * sparse mid-zoom layout. Dashicon-glyph nodes remain available via
 * `setNodeStyle( 'icon' )`. Focused node + 1-hop neighbourhood pop;
 * the focused node is *pinned* during focus so it doesn't drift
 * around under the camera.
 *
 * Interactions:
 *   - **Wheel** smoothly zooms with the cursor as the focal point.
 *   - **Drag empty canvas** pans the world.
 *   - **Drag a node** pins it to the cursor and reheats the sim.
 *   - **Click a node** emits `onNodeClick`. The host fetches detail and
 *     calls `setFocusedDetail()`, which paints the satellites.
 *   - **Click background** clears focus + satellites.
 *
