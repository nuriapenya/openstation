Turn wp-admin into a desktop OS — windows, dock, virtual desktops, and an AI assistant. Per-user opt-in, zero Core changes. By Automattic.

== Description ==

**Your WordPress admin, reimagined as a desktop.** Every admin screen opens as a draggable, resizable window — edit a post, browse the Media Library, and moderate comments side by side instead of one page at a time.

OpenStation is opt-in per user: one click in the admin bar switches you in, one click switches you back. Nobody else on the site sees any change, and deactivating the plugin restores the classic admin exactly. Zero Core patches — every feature runs through public WordPress hooks.

Built and maintained by [Automattic](https://automattic.com), the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack, WooCommerce, and Tumblr.

= A real desktop =

* **Windows** — drag, resize, minimize, maximize, snap, tile. Every admin page works, including plugin pages.
* **Dock & taskbar** — the admin menu becomes an icon dock; open windows live in a macOS-style taskbar.
* **Virtual desktops (Spaces)** — one desktop for writing, another for the store, another for moderation.
* **Files on the desktop** — drop posts, media, and links onto the wallpaper, organize them into folders, trash them to the Trash.
* **Session restore** — reload the browser and every window comes back exactly where you left it.

= Make it yours =

* **Wallpapers** — color presets, animated scenes, or your own image.
* **Widgets & desktop icons** — pin live widgets and shortcuts to the wallpaper; plugins can register their own.

= Superpowers =

* **AI Assistant (optional)** — press Cmd+K and ask *"Which post had the comment asking for the recipe?"* It searches your own content. Requires an AI provider configured in **Settings → Connectors** (WordPress 7.0+); see "External services" below.
* **Corkboard** — an interactive, zoomable map of how your posts, pages, and products link together.
* **Cross-window drag & drop** — drag an image from the Media Library window straight into the editor in another window.
* **Command palette** — the full WordPress command palette plus slash commands from plugins, all under Cmd+K.

= Built to be extended =

Every significant behavior is hookable. Register windows, dock items, wallpapers, widgets, desktop icons, commands, settings tabs, and AI tools from your own plugin — stable `openstation_register_*` PHP APIs, a typed JavaScript API, and copy-paste examples in the [developer docs on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/openstation/tree/trunk/docs).

= External services =

This plugin's optional **AI Assistant** sends data to the **AI provider you configure in WordPress's Settings → Connectors** (for example OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google). Generation is routed through WordPress 7.0's built-in AI Client, which supplies the credentials stored in Connectors — the plugin never handles an API key itself. With no provider configured in Connectors, no external AI requests are made.

When the AI Assistant is enabled and a user invokes it (via Cmd+K or the slash-command palette):

* **What is sent:** the user's prompt, the conversation history for the active session, and tool-call metadata. The plugin's built-in tools (`search_posts`, `search_pages`, `search_comments`) run WordPress's native keyword search and may include excerpts of the matching posts/pages/comments in tool results, which are then sent back to the provider as part of the agentic loop.
* **When it is sent:** on user-initiated AI requests, and (if an administrator enables "Score new comments with AI") on comment-save hooks for spam analysis. Posts, pages, and taxonomy terms are not sent automatically.
* **Why it is sent:** to obtain model completions and tool-call decisions that drive the AI Assistant.
* **Who provides the service:** whichever provider you configured in Settings → Connectors. Which provider (and endpoint) receives the data depends entirely on that configuration — review the chosen provider's own terms and privacy policy (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google).

No other external services are contacted by this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress.
3. Click the **desktop** icon in the admin bar's top-right corner. The admin reloads inside the desktop shell.
4. Click the same icon again at any time to return to the classic admin.

= Optional: enable the AI Assistant =

1. In **Settings → Connectors**, set up an AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google). Requires WordPress 7.0+.
2. In OpenStation, open **OS Settings → Features** and turn on **AI assistant** (it's off by default).
3. Press **Cmd+K** (or **Ctrl+K**) anywhere in OpenStation to open the AI assistant.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this change anything for users who don't opt in? =

No. The classic admin is untouched until a user toggles OpenStation on for themselves. Deactivating the plugin restores vanilla Core exactly.

= Does the plugin require an external service to function? =

No. The desktop shell, windowing, dock, taskbar, virtual desktops, widgets, wallpapers, and all extension APIs work entirely on-site. The AI Assistant is the only feature that contacts an external service, and it stays inert until an administrator configures an AI provider in Settings → Connectors. See "External services" in the description.

= Does it patch WordPress core? =

No. Every feature is wired through public WordPress actions and filters.

= How do I disable OpenStation for my user? =

Click the desktop icon in the admin bar a second time to flip the toggle off. The plugin can also be deactivated globally from the Plugins screen.

= Where is the developer documentation? =

In `docs/` inside the plugin, and on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/openstation/tree/trunk/docs). The hook reference, JavaScript reference, bridge protocol, and copy-paste examples all live there.

== Screenshots ==

1. Real multitasking — Users, Media, and content editing open side by side as windows.
2. Your admin, your desktop — custom wallpapers and live widgets registered by plugins.
3. The AI Assistant (Cmd+K) answers questions about your own posts, pages, and comments.
4. Corkboard — an interactive map of how your content links together.
5. OS Settings — pick a wallpaper preset, an animated scene, or upload your own image.
6. Files on the desktop — drag posts, media, and links onto the wallpaper and into folders.
7. The Trash collects trashed posts, media, folders, and shortcuts in one window.

== Credits ==

OpenStation is brought to you by [Automattic](https://automattic.com). The plugin is open source under GPLv2-or-later; contributions are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/openstation).

= Third-party libraries =

The plugin bundles the following third-party JavaScript library, loaded on demand only when a feature that needs it is in use:

* **[PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)** (MIT License) — used by the interactive **OS Settings → About** scene, the **Corkboard** window, built-in canvas wallpapers (e.g. the animated WordPress logo), and the **Inkfall** typing game. PixiJS is loaded from the plugin's own `assets/vendor/` directory; no CDN requests are made.

= Data files =

The **Inkfall** game's word list (`assets/games/inkfall/words.txt`) is generated from the following sources (attribution also ships in the file's header):

* **[FrequencyWords](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords)** by Hermit Dave (CC-BY-SA 4.0) — English word-frequency ranking derived from the OpenSubtitles corpus.
* **[english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)** by dwyl (Unlicense) — used as a validity filter.
* **[LDNOOBW English list](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words)** (CC-BY 4.0) — used as an exclusion filter.

== Changelog ==

= 0.9.9 =
* Desktop Mode is now OpenStation — new name, new look, same plugin. Settings, files, sessions and desktop layouts carry over untouched.
* A new palette and typography, with four wallpapers: Galaxy (the new default), Space, Holomesh and Pulsemesh.
* Desktop Mode (Legacy) — a built-in desktop theme that puts the previous look back in one click, WordPress blue included.
* Mio — a soft-body desk companion that drifts across the wallpaper and gets pushed around by your windows. Off by default; turn it on from the dock.
* Holographic controls — switches, primary buttons and selected items catch an iridescent mesh on hover and press.
* New Switch component, and a searchable Components tab in OS Settings.
* Custom post types now appear in the site window, grouped into a folder named after the plugin or theme that registered them.
* Post tiles show their featured image instead of a generic icon, which turns a catalogue into a photo grid.
* WooCommerce — Orders, Products and Coupons as browsable folders, with out-of-stock, low-stock, backorder and sale ribbons, and a details pane showing price, stock, order totals, line items and coupon usage.
* Plugins can accept files dropped onto their own desktop icon, via `wp.os.files.registerTilePayloadHandler()`.
* The Games leaderboard refreshes the moment a run finishes, instead of waiting for a reload.
* Fix closed windows reappearing after a refresh, and window state being lost when several windows were closed in quick succession.
* Fix the widget column rendering empty.
* Desktop icons and file tiles now fade out in Overview, so they no longer collide with window thumbnails.
* Fix `wp.os.activity.subscribe()` never receiving events — channel names containing a slash were silently rejected.
* The portal URL moved from `/desktop-mode/` to `/openstation/`. Reinstall the app if you added OpenStation to your home screen.
* For plugin authors: `wp.desktop` is now `wp.os`, `<wpd-*>` components are `<os-*>`, and PHP functions and hooks use the `openstation_` prefix. Stored data — options, meta, custom tables, REST namespaces and the WordPress.org slug — is unchanged.
